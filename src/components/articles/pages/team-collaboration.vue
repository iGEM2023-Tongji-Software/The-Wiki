                    "It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed." This year, we have collaborated with
                    numerous teams both online and offline, learning valuable lessons from our interactions with each team. Furthermore, we have
                    skillfully applied our abilities to assist other teams in multiple areas, such as education, HP, modeling, among others. We have
                    communicated and collaborated with all the teams in AI&Software Village in China this year.

                    Tongji-China is another team from Tongji University participating in iGEM. Being from the same college, we are familiar with each
                    other. As a result, we have been exchanging experiences since the formation of our teams. This includes collaborating on topic
                    selection and reporting for the college's iGEM activities. We also worked together on advancing our human practice, jointly
                    spreading knowledge of synthetic biology to many fellow students and schoolchildren, along with information about our project. We
                    have achieved extensive cooperation in project management, schedule planning, and Jamboree coordination, providing mutual
                    assistance.

                    We, along with WHU-China, jointly explored the applications of the CRISPR-Cas system in synthetic biology during a CRISPR exchange
                    event in China. Since both of our teams utilize CRISPR technology in our projects, we engaged in in-depth discussions, asked each
                    other questions, and suggested improvements for each other's projects. We also collaborated with other schools on the
                    conceptualization, design, and creation of a CRISPR brochure, with the hope of popularizing the principles and techniques of
                    CRISPR technology to a wider audience and fostering a passion for the field of synthetic biology.

                    CJUH-JLU-China Similar to WHU-China and us, CJUH-JLU-China also applied CRISPR-Cas technology in this year's iGEM competition.
                    Like with WHU-China, we shared our projects and design ideas during meetings, asked each other questions, and deepened our
                    understanding of CRISPR technology. We also collaborated on creating a CRISPR technology brochure.

                    In May, we reached out to Junjie Zhu and Xinyu Qian of SJTU-Software, and were surprised to discover that our project themes
                    shared remarkable similarities. Both teams operate in the software domain with overlapping backgrounds in biology and computer
                    science. As a result, we exchanged numerous suggestions for project design and algorithms, offering valuable assistance to one
                    another.

                <p>
                    In fact, our collaboration transcends the mere definition of cooperation, encompassing a deep level of mutual support and shared

                    often collaborate and engage in regular exchanges. They have been immensely helpful and provided us with valuable assistance and
                    suggestions regarding Jamboree journey-related matters, making our planning process smoother. In addition to that, they approached
                    us for a joint effort in creating a picture book.

                    USTC-Software is another team focused on software this year. They plan to develop an auxiliary software for protein sequence
                    design optimization this year. We believe that their software is very practical and can help biologists alleviate many troubles.
                    We started communication with them in May, and our project also has certain similarities with theirs. There are many areas of
                    exchange in terms of front-end and back-end development.

                    SYSU-Software is also a team focused on software. We have exchanges with them every year. This year, our project is not very
                    similar to theirs, so we didn't have in-depth discussions on model and other issues. However, after we developed our mini-game,
                    they expressed great interest in it. They carefully watched the introduction video of our mini-game and even tried playing it.
                    After trying it out, they provided us with many suggestions for improvement.

                    from various species. We think their project is very useful to humans so we keep communicating with them since we met at CCiC
                    meeting. We regularly update the progress of our two teams, and we also invited them to try out our mini-game.

                    conference and have been regularly exchanging progress updates since then. At the synbio plus AI conference, we discussed the
                    application of AI in synthetic biology. Subsequently, we had an in-depth discussion of both teams' projects in an online exchange
                    meeting.

                    On July 8th-11th, CCiC(The Conference of China iGEMer Community) was successfully held. We fortunately attended this conferance
                    and presented our project to other Chinese iGEM teams. It is worthwhile to mention that we got suggestive advice from many experts
                    and other teams on this meeting.

                <p>
                    Even more encouragingly, we communicated with other iGEM teams like WHU-China. During this exchange, we learned about each other's

                    On July 27th, we held a online meeting on the topic of CRISPR&synbio. More than twenty members from six teams actively
                    participated in the meeting. Each team presented their respective projects, with a special focus on the aspects related to CRISPR.
                    Subsequently, we engaged in extensive discussions about our projects, as well as the past and future developments of CRISPR and
                    synthetic biology.

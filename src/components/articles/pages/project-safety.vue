                    CASleuth is safe enough for users and their computers. It is redundant to worry about our software's safety. Because you only need
                    to visit our website and query for results. All the computing operations were done on our server. Additionally, the files we
                    provided were also safe to download on user's own equipment.

                    The data sources of our software are described in the wiki, and the tools we use are free and open source, so there are no
                    copyright issues. In addition, all references in the wiki are also stated. You can use our data and software with confidence.

                    We have done a software project that does not involve experiments with organisms or parts. We use public data to build a gRNA
                    design tool applied to Crispr virus detection which are candidate tools for synthetic biology. It will be safe and secure.

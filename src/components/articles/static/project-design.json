For the three models we have trained, the scale of the training set is roughly in the range of tens of thousands of records. This remains insufficient for a deep learning model. Therefore, in future training efforts, employing self-distillation could be advantageous. This involves training an initial teacher model with a certain level of accuracy, followed by training a precision prediction model that forecasts the teacher model's accuracy. Subsequently, the precision prediction model is used to select superior data generated by the teacher model, which is then used to train a student model with the same architecture as the teacher model. Through self-distillation, the student model benefits not only from training with true labels but also from additional insights derived from the teacher model's predictions. This aids in enhancing the student model's generalization on unlabeled data and, in some cases, could surpass the performance of the teacher model. Moreover, self-distillation contributes to model compression, given that student models generally possess fewer parameters than teacher models.",

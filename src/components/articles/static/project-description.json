Traditional PCR virus detection methods must rely on laboratory facilities and the experimental procedures are extremely complex. It often takes several hours from sample collection to detection, making it difficult and inefficient to screen and diagnose individuals during a major outbreak, particularly in technologically underdeveloped areas.Therefore, the idea of using faster, simpler and cheaper infectious disease testing methods come to our mind,and we hope it can change the current situation.",

Furthermore, the form of direct detection using test kits is also more friendly for impoverished areas affected by pandemic.In virus detection methods based on CRISPR system, the targeting efficiency of cas protein-bound gRNA (guide RNA) is a key factor for accurate detection.

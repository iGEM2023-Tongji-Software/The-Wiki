        <p class="ds-content-title">Why This Project</p>
        <p class="ds-content-text-why-p1">The COVID-19 pandemic has affected nearly everyone's life, and in the process
            of combating the pandemic, rapid and accurate virus detection methods are crucial. Traditional PCR virus
            detection methods must rely on laboratory facilities and the experimental procedures are extremely complex.
            It often takes several hours from sample collection to detection, making it difficult and inefficient to
            screen and diagnose individuals during a major outbreak, particularly in technologically underdeveloped
            areas.Therefore, the idea of using faster, simpler and cheaper infectious disease testing methods come to
            our mind,and we hope it can change the current situation.
        </p>
        <p class="ds-content-text-why-p2">
            Under the circumstances, we have found a new weapon for virus detection - a new detection tool based on the
            CRISPR-Cas system. Compared with traditional PCR methods, CRISPR-Cas detection tools are considered to have
            a good future, being more rapid, portable, economical and requiring less environmental equipment.
            Furthermore, the form of direct detection using test kits is also more friendly for impoverished areas
            affected by pandemic.In virus detection methods based on CRISPR system, the targeting efficiency of cas
            protein-bound gRNA (guide RNA) is a key factor for accurate detection.
        </p>
        <p class="ds-content-text-why-p3">
            We have learned that the majority of existing gRNA design methods for virus detection only use one single
            CRISPR-Cas system to target a single or a few viruses systematically.Currently,there is a lack of a concise,
            rapid and accurate gRNA design tool for different viruses and different CRISPR-Cas systems. Therefore,
            related research can fill the gaps in the field of synthetic biology.
        </p>
        <p class="ds-content-text-why-p4">
            Thus, our project, CASleuth, was born.

        <p class="ds-content-title">How We Start</p>
        <p class="ds-content-text-how-p1">However, we didnâ€™t know how to utilize our knowledge to improve the current
            situation of virus detection. Fortunately, after extensive research, we discovered that most traditional
            gRNA design tools focused on the gene editing instead of virus detection. This realization inspired us to
            create a gRNA design tool by recommending gRNA that could detect the target virus efficiently to reach our
            purpose of making large-scale virus detection easier. </p>
        <p class="ds-content-text-how-p2">While exploring the iGEM projects of recent years, we have came across some
            CRISPR virus detection methods applied in synthetic biology but relevant software was quite rare. After
            consulting and communicating with our PI, We conducted a brainstorming session and finalized the details of
            our project. Following that, we started our project by collecting relevant gRNA data and applying methods
            such as deep learning.

        <p class="ds-content-title">What We Are Doing</p>
        <p class="ds-content-text-what-p1">Machine learning would benefit viral detection by designing assays that are
            more sensitive than existing ones.That is surprising in light of machine learning and the explosion of viral
            genomic data. Our project used a deep learning framework based on convolutional neural networks to
            analytically compute the relationship between gRNA sequence, target sequence and gRNA activity. After
            training, we developed a gRNA design tool applied to CRISPR virus detection to recommend gRNAs that can
            efficiently detect the target virus. We finally put the recommended results into the database we
            constructed.
        </p>
        <p class="ds-content-text-what-p2">We believe that in the near future, CRISPR-based virus detection method will
            fill the gap of global healthcare system. We hope it will provide more opportunities for large-scale
            population screening, wider dissemination of diagnostic technologies and field deployment of diagnostics to
            control the spread of infectious diseases.

        <p class="ds-content-title">Brightened Dot And Difficulties We Overcome</p>
        <p class="ds-content-text-distinct-p1">In the footsteps of our project, we have not moved forward with smooth
            sailing. Like solving a puzzle, we have tried to explore the binding mechanism of each CRISPR-cas system
            first before developing the optimal gRNA algorithm.
            <br><br>
            Then, downloading and organizing the mountains of data became one of our challenges. We have to find
            valuable information from this pile of data in order to uncover its treasures.
            <br><br>
            Of course, there were some unexpected decisions in the project. In the absence of direct virus detection
            data, we used editing efficiency as a substitute. This alter ensured the amount of our training data.
            <br><br>
            What was even more surprising was the incorporation of epigenetic factors. This seemingly uncommon
            combination had the unexpected effect of making our training even better.
            <br><br>
            Our accuracy was not satisfactory in the initial machine-learning model. After reviewing the literature and
            communicating with experts, we elevated it to new heights.
            <br><br>
            What makes our project unique compared to existing platforms is that we have extended our database to
            include a variety of Cas systems. Furthermore, we have transformed the classification into regression, which
            offers the users more options.
            <br><br>
            Finally, our platform not only seeks to aid with virus detection but also strives to be user-friendly. For
            example, we present target sequences and running efficiency in a visual way to researchers, making research
            more intuitive, understandable, and interesting.
